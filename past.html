        <p>
          I was good at maths and physics at high school and had a keen interest in
          understanding how things work especially about electronic devices. Therefore, 
          I decided to study engineering at uni 
          majoring in electrical engineering. However, after a few months I lost my 
          passion and found the course to be hard. I switched to Computer Science and
          am happy now :)
          <br></br>
          The first website I ever created was in Year 10, I had no knowledge of CSS,
          all the little bits of styling was done in the HTML tags itself.<br>
          Sadly, I don't have many work experices as I have studied full time since childhood
          and goofed around part time.
