            The website has four webpages and one styling sheet. All pages have
            the same header and footer to maintain consistency for navigation.
            The header includes links back to the homepage and other subpages.
            The footer includes social links and copyright tags. The table below
            gives an overview of the webpages.

      <h2>Design</h2>
      <div class="body-div-c">
        <p>
          The entire code for the webpage is written on Microsoft’s Visual
          Studio Code. It has built in support for autocompleting html tags
          which saves a lot of time. Additionally, a live server can be created
          to view live changes in codes. Throughout the process of creating my
          webpage I discovered a lot of resources that were of immense help to
          me such as the color palette generator, openpeeps.com. <br /><br />
          To create styles and good layouts for multiple elements for the
          website the &lt;div&gt; and &lt;spans&gt; are used extensively to
          style them individually and use the same for other elements too. The
          class header-nav are footer-nav is used as a parent class for the
          header and footer element respectively.<br /><br />
          .header-nav & .footer-nav<br />
          By using these class selectors, the display is set to flex which
          arranges the elements in a container for better layout. That is the
          text ‘VISHAL PRASAD’ and the other anchor tag links are stored in a
          container. Further, by using the display: inline-block; the unordered
          list of reference links are aligned in one line. <br /><br />
          .main-body & .container <br />
          Using these selectors that are assigned to the main section, the body
          is given a proper layout such as adding margin, styling heading and
          images.

        <h2>Aesthetics</h2>

        <div id="body-div-cm-layout" class="body-div-c">
          <p>
            Websites are visual as much as they are content. It is important for
            the user to get the message clearly without the extra clutter. This
            websites integrates imagery and various elemnts into the background
            and layout of a website to significantly contribute to the visual
            appeal. Below are some of the features used
          </p>
        </div>
        <h4>font choice</h4>
        <div id="body-div-cm-layout" class="body-div-c">
          <p>
            Clear text is important for webpage aesthetics. It should be not be
            overcomplicated with text having tricky fonts or effects.
            <br />
            The font used in this webpage is sans-serif which is used in most of
            the sites on the internet making it pleasing and comfartable for the
            users to read. Adittionaly, the font color used is of greyish shade
            instead of black. Black text on white background is very contrasty
            putting strain on eyes.
          </p>
        </div>
        <h4>colours</h4>
        <div class="body-div-c">
          <p>
            Colours are proabbly one of the major contributing factor to
            designing a webpage. A colour palatte is choosed for this webiste
            which matches the style of the webpage. This allowed better visual
            interplay and readability of colors for text, images, and
            background.
          </p>
          <img
            src="images/colours.png"
            alt="an image of the color paltte used in the web"
          />
        </div>
        <h4>layout</h4>
        <div id="body-div-cm-layout" class="body-div-c">
          <p>
            A good layout is critical to aesthetic design. This website has a
            very neat and simple header and footer. The backgound colour fully
            blends with background of the main body making it less distinctive
            from the rest of the page
          </p>
        </div>
        <h4>pictures</h4>
        <div class="body-div-c">
          <p>
            Pictures convey information better than using text, be it in a
            report, infographic or Websites. Throught the 'comments' webpage
            numerous pictures has been used to further add on the information
            given by text
          </p>
          <img
            src="images/pictures.png"
            alt="screenshot of the pictures used in the web"
          />
        </div>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>Accessibility</h2>
        <div class="body-div-c">
          <p>
            The Web is fundamentally designed to work for all people, whatever
            their hardware, software, language, location, or ability must be
            able to perceive, or understand and be aware of, the content and
            information that’s presented on your website
          </p>
          <img
            src="images/accessibility.png"
            alt="a snip of code showing alt text is used for images"
          />
        </div>
        <div id="body-div-cm-layout" class="body-div-c">
          <p>
            Every single element in the webpage has been given an alt text, so
            that screen reader users can understand the message conveyed by the
            use of images on the page.
            <br /><br />
            Screen reader users use heading structure to navigate content. They
            will have no trouble understanding the content of this website as
            headers (h1&gt;, h2&gt;, etc.) are used correctly and strategically.
            Additionally, the in &lt;em&gt; tag has been used so that a screen
            reader will pronounce the words with an emphasis, using verbal
            stress.
            <br /><br />
            Another key aspect of accessibility is to make the content
            accessible to different kinds of devices. The website should hold
            its layout on multiple aspects ratio. This has been tackled by using
            &lt;mteta&gt; tag and setting the viewport to make the website look
            good on all devices.
          </p>

      <div>
        <h2>Learnings</h2>
        <div class="body-div-c">
          <p>
            Designing this website gave me the golden opportunity to sharpen my
            skills in HTML and CSS which I have been always wanting to do. I had
            very less knowledge about so many aspects of a webpage before
            working on this assigment.<br />
            One of my favorite elements in CSS is the flexbox. It is a layout
            model providing easy and clean way of arranging items within a
            container. Using this saved me a lot of time creating the footer of
            the webpage. The footer consisted of a text and an unordered list of
            social links which was to be squashed in the same line.
          </p>
          <img src="images/flexbox.png" alt="graphic of a fexbox" />
        </div>
        <div class="body-div-c">
          <p>
            Another tool which I would highly recommend to anyone designing a
            webpage is to use developer tools of a browser (Firefox works the
            best). This <span>helped</span> me a lot in debugging and
            understanding how the element and CSS selectors are recognized by
            the browser to display the webpage. It also shows a box model of the
            selected element making it easier for the developer (me) to see what
            values should be given to margins, padding and border that makes
            sense.
